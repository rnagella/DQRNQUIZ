Hello Double Qliiq, I'm Ranjith Nagella and this project is part of the
assignment that I received from Ryan Webb. I would like to Thank you
for taking time to review my assignment.

Here are few things worth noticing
Library's
- react-native -  0.34.1 to develop this project.
- react - 15.3.2

- Along with the React Native Library, I used following community library's to
ease my development
- For Route Navigation - Ex-Navigation : https://github.com/exponentjs/ex-navigation - A route-centric,
navigation library
<!-- Note: Install component using npm as npm i @exponent/ex-navigation babel-preset-react-native-stage-0 --save
Change your .babelrc (if you have one, if not, then create one):
{
  "presets": ["react-native-stage-0/decorator-support"]
} -->

- For Icons and Fonts - https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons
<!-- Note: Install component using npm as npm install react-native-vector-icons --save
Also, for setting up the icons manually on iOS refer the documentation at https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons
 -->

 <!-- Or -->
 <!-- Simply fetch the project from the GitHub and run < npm i >
The dependencies will be downloaded. Please note that you still have to set up manullay the icons
based on the platform
 -->
